A place to keep all Project NexTech-related materials, including website code, programming course examples, programming course assets, and more.

Welcome to the Project NexTech GitHub repository! This is associated with the STEM education nonprofit organization called Project NexTech. We use this repository to store the code for our website (currently still under development), ProjectNexTech.org, and materials for some of the STEM courses that we offer (namely those of the Programming department).
